# Gradient and divergence on a Graph

Let $G = (V,\Omega)$ be a weighted graph. The adjacency matrix $E$ splits
(in many ways) into the sum of two adjacency matrices of directed
graphs in such a way that $E = \overrightarrow E + \overleftarrow E$. Let
$M(G)$ be the vector space of matrices whose support is contained in
the support of $E$. Similarly, we define symmetric matrices $S(G)$ and
skew-symmetric matrices $A(G)$. Both this special cases are
characterised on either $\overrightarrow E$ or $\overleftarrow E$.

If $\Theta$ is a weight on $G$, define the scalar product

Let us call *potential* a mapping $\Phi \colon V \to \mathbb R$.
